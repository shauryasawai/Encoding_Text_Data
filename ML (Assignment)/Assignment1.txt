Assignment 2:

In this assignment, you'll be working with a dataset from Kaggle titled "Fashion
Clothing Products Catalog." You can access the dataset by visiting
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog and
downloading it. Your task is to develop a content based recommendation system
using vector databases such as qdrant and weaviate. To encode text data effectively,
you'll utilize BERT, a powerful language representation model. Don't worry if you're
not familiar with these technologies â€“ the assignment is designed to introduce you
to them step by step. By completing this task, you'll gain practical experience in
building recommendation systems and working with advanced text encoding
techniques.
Please note that these assignments are designed to be approachable for students
with varying levels of experience in artificial intelligence and programming. If you
encounter any difficulties or have questions along the way, feel free to reach out for
assistance. Both assignments should be completed by the upcoming Sunday, and
you're encouraged to submit any questions or concerns you may have throughout
the process.
